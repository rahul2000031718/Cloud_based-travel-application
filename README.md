# Cloud-powered travel platform
....................................

## OBJECTIVE:
Building a cloud powered travel application which helps user to plan and manage trip using the AWS services.

## Demo of Application [URL](https://travelocloud.com/)

## Project Introduction

Travel-O-Cloud is a one stop application targeted to help users plan their lovely trip with the help of features like booking a hotel, checking for weather conditions, helping them store their trip memories in the form of images. And all this by securely logging in to the application using AWS Login or by using social identity providers like Google or Facebook. Users will be able to check for the current weather in their choice of city and book a hotel using Chatbot for their stay. Users will be able to upload the pictures from the places that they have visited and store it safely, moreover, they can also share the pictures on Facebook and retrieve the pictures from their trip to obtain highlights of locations.

## Requirements and Procedures:

-Design your application architecture: Start by planning the architecture of your application, including how the different AWS services will work together. This could include creating a diagram of your application, defining your data model, and deciding on which AWS services you will use.
-Set up your environment: Begin by creating a new AWS account and setting up your environment with AWS services, such as AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, and AWS SDKs.
-Use Amazon S3 to store static files: S3 can be used to store static content like images, videos, and other media files.
-Use Amazon Elastic Beanstalk to deploy and run your application: Elastic Beanstalk is a fully managed service that makes it easy to deploy and scale web applications.
-Use Amazon Route 53 for domain registration and routing: Route 53 is a DNS service that can be used for domain registration and routing.
-Use Amazon CloudFormation for infrastructure as code: CloudFormation can be used to create and manage a collection of AWS resources.
-Use Amazon Cognito for authentication and user management: Cognito can be used to manage user authentication and authorization.
-Use Amazon API Gateway to create RESTful APIs: API Gateway can be used to create RESTful APIs that integrate with your application.
-Use Amazon Lex for conversational interfaces: Lex can be used to create conversational interfaces such as chatbots.
-Use Amazon DynamoDB for NoSQL database: DynamoDB can be used for storing data in a NoSQL database.
-Use Amazon Lambda for serverless computing: Lambda can be used for serverless computing where you can execute your code without provisioning and managing servers.
-Use Amazon SNS for notification service: SNS can be used for sending push notifications to your users.
-Use Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring and logging: CloudWatch can be used to monitor and log your application's performance and events.
-Use Amazon SageMaker for machine learning: SageMaker can be used for machine learning models to enhance your application.
-Use Amazon CodePipeline for continuous integration and delivery: CodePipeline can be used for continuous integration and delivery of your application code.

## Conclusion:
Building a travel-based application in AWS can provide a reliable, scalable, and secure solution for the travel industry. AWS offers a suite of services that can be used to create a comprehensive travel application, including storage solutions, deployment tools, authentication, and API management.
By utilizing AWS services such as Elastic Beanstalk, Route 53, DynamoDB, Lambda, and others, developers can build a flexible and cost-effective travel-based application that can scale with the growing needs of the business. Additionally, AWS provides a range of machine learning and analytics tools, such as SageMaker, that can be used to optimize the application's performance and provide valuable insights into user behavior.
Overall, AWS offers a powerful and robust platform for creating travel-based applications that can help businesses enhance customer experience, increase efficiency, and improve profitability.
